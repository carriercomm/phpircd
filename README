phpircd v0.3.07
this readme is a changelog lololol

7/21/2011 -
* Fixed PRIVMSG when PMing.

7/20/2011 -
* Cleaned up the main file (ircd) a bit- compiled an un-needed foreach into another, amongst other things.
* Fixed checking for 'Client Exited' socket status when quitting spontaneously.
* Fixed possible but in regex (sytax error?).
* Using ircd::$allowed instead of ircd::$forbidden.
* Cleaned up some stuff in the ircd class
* Added ircd::nickInUse() for better nick checking.
* Did away with core::$_nicks.
* I don't remember what else :(
(edit 1)
* Fixed some bugs with PHP 5.1.6 - Regex escaping and finding users with keys (not preserved)
* Added ircd::getUserBySocket()
(edit 2)
* Removed double read-loop in file 'ircd'- now all processed by 1.
* Moved accept code to ircd::accept().
* Fixed NAMES- was trying to access Channel::$nick which does not exist.
* Various bugfixes.

7/19/2011 -
* Thanks again to cedr and Kuro for testing.
* QUIT now works as expected. Need to tweak it for ping timeouts/etc.
* TOPIC now properly announces.
* NAMES fixed again.
* More later!
(edit 1)
* Added fix for ipv6-enabled boxes with ipv4 addresses (adds ::ffff:).
* Changed config.ini to all double-qoutes, as the single quotes broke everything on some boxes.
* Changed core::close() to ircd::quit() when server full.
(edit 2)
* Fixed issue with NICK where leading colon was not stripped.
* Added utility method ircd::stripColon
* Added utility method ircd::checkRealName
* Object-ized users. Each user is now stored as an object so it's cleaner (and easier) to do things. Will move methods later.
* Added messages for being disconnected on Ping Timeout/etc.
* New versioning concept: (major).(minor).(build). Still in major version 0 as we're not even a complete IRCd yet. Minor will change whenever I feel like flexing my version-changing muscle.
(edit 3)
* Thanks to Pedrobear for some pointers.
* Class ircd now extends core. No more `global $core;'!
* Added Channel class and methods.
* Added methods to User class.
* Almost all sending is now done through User::send() or Channel::send().
* Channel::send(msg[, excl]) accepts optional 'excl'- a User object to exclude in sending (as in PRIVMSG).

7/18/2011 - 
* Thanks for all the help from #Frantech: cedr, InsDel, Corbin, and others!
* NAMES now announces on join and tracks nick changes properly
* Fixed part of TOPIC having a wrong variable name, however TOPIC is still broken.
* PART now announces, and passes through custom PART mesages
* Some work on QUIT, however it's still hopelessly broken as well.
* NICK now announces properly to the whole channel, instead of announcing to you once for everyone in the channel (oops).
* NICK now ignores you when "changing" your nick to what it already is.
* Removed NAMESX from message 005 since we don't actually support it, yet.

4/18/2011 -
* Bored in Java class
* Fixed some weird spacing
* Added die() for config parse failure
* Fixed core::write(): was turncating at 513, not 512, characters. Derp.
* Hopefully I can make some headway on this soon

7/20/2010 -
* JOIN progress. Error checking, you can now `join' a channel, +k doesn't work yet, you can't chat on the
  channel, no topic, no names etc.. but it's progress. 40+ hour work weeks have me a bit tied up so I'm
  doing what I can with the time I have available.
(edit 1)
* Added client field for ip address.
* JOIN now creates the channel in $core->_channels if it doesn't exist.
* TOPIC added, minus support for chaning the topic (so far).
* PRIVMSG now supports sending messages to channels (YAY). Bug needs to be fixed: users remain in the
  channel array when disconnected, casuing errors galore.
(edit 2)
* Fixed issue with NICK where users were told their nick was erroneous if it was too long (instead of just
  shortening it for them).
* NAMES support added. Splits messages that are >510 characters.
* $core->write() automatically turncates strings at 512 characters (including \r\n) per rfc requirements.

7/17/2010 -
* PRIVMSG works for inter-user communication on the same server only.
* $core->_nicks array for keeping track of in-use nicks more efficiently.
* More error codes added.
* Fixed the PING timeout error for reals this time.
* Typo fixes.
(edit 1)
* Fixed missing leading colon on PRIVMSG commands.
* Made last activity (lastpong) update on every command, valid or not.
* Fixed asthetic error where command errors were not returned uppercase.

7/13/2010 -
* NICK command now works, minus sending it to channels, seeing as JOIN hasn't been made yet.
* QUIT command also works, with the same current caveats of NICK.
* Fixed space in 005 message after PREFIX
* Fixed PING issue where command were not being treated as activity.
* Added more error messages, including ERR_NOTREGISTERED, ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND and ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE.
* Version is now 0.2b because I have no scheme to the version numbers and like to change them frequently.

7/12/2010 -
* Sorta-finished welcome sequence. MOTD displays, if there is one (motd.txt), if not it throws ERR_NOMOTD.
* Working on NOTICE AUTH to make the welcome complete. Not implementing ident, for reasoning read here:
  http://web.archive.org/web/20050828200336/http://www.clock.org/~fair/opinion/identd.html
* More configuration options added to config.ini, not implemented yet.
* opers.ini added with example syntax, though also not implemented yet.
* fixed an error with the socket becoming unavailable for re-use if the program is inturrupted
  mid-communication with a client or shut down with clients still connected.
(edit 1)
* PING/PONG works now. Or at least the important parts (making sure the user still responds to PING).
* Users can also now PING the server.
* Pingfreq and pingout variables in the conf now utilized.
* Fixed a bug where sending multiple commands in one message (i.e. NICK slowbro\r\nUSER h h h :Real Name)
  would cause immense amounts of errors and headaches.
* Fixed MOTD display to remove extra newlines.
* Fixed post-registration USER command; it now throws ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED.
* NOTICE AUTH functionality complete, and working 100%.
* Fixed an bug causing external networks to not be able to remain connected to the server due to using
  PHP_NORMAL_READ instead of PHP_BINARY_READ on the socket_read() function.
* Version is now 0.2a

7/11/2010 -
* Fixed security hole (already) in ircd.class.php that would allow clients to call functions they
  weren't supposed to such as newConnection().
* Fixed a performance issue with socket_select() and its if bracket.

7/10/2010 -
* Error handling function introduced.
(edit 1)
* Welcome message(s) progress. Need to figure out the 005 numeric which is now RPL_ISUPPORT, probably 
  going to just fill it with nonsense for now until the server is more complete and it is needed.
* More error checking added on initial connect, check for parameter amount, and checks params against
  some regex.
* Dicks everywhere.

7/9/2010 -
* Basically a plain socket server at the moment.
(edit 1)
* Babysteps towards actual irc stuff. Closes link on ping timeout, working on initial connect sequence.
* Expect ircd.class.php rolled out within a day or so.
(edit 2)
* Initial ircd class release.
* NICK error checking working for initial connect. USER next.
* Still need to legitimately NOTICE AUTH instead of just sending that junk.

7/8/2010 -
* Initial alpha-absolutely-nothing-is-done-at-all release.
