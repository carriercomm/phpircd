phpircd v0.2a
this readme is a changelog lololol


7/12/2010 -
* Sorta-finished welcome sequence. MOTD displays, if there is one (motd.txt), if not it throws ERR_NOMOTD.
* Working on NOTICE AUTH to make the welcome complete. Not implementing ident, for reasoning read here:
  http://web.archive.org/web/20050828200336/http://www.clock.org/~fair/opinion/identd.html
* More configuration options added to config.ini, not implemented yet.
* opers.ini added with example syntax, though also not implemented yet.
* fixed an error with the socket becoming unavailable for re-use if the program is inturrupted
  mid-communication with a client or shut down with clients still connected.
(edit 1)
* PING/PONG works now. Or at least the important parts (making sure the user still responds to PING).
* Users can also now PING the server.
* Pingfreq and pingout variables in the conf now utilized.
* Fixed a bug where sending multiple commands in one message (i.e. NICK slowbro\r\nUSER h h h :Real Name)
  would cause immense amounts of errors and headaches.
* Fixed MOTD display to remove extra newlines.
* Fixed post-registration USER command; it now throws ERR_ALREADYREGISTERED.
* NOTICE AUTH functionality complete, and working 100%.
* Fixed an bug causing external networks to not be able to remain connected to the server due to using
  PHP_NORMAL_READ instead of PHP_BINARY_READ on the socket_read() function.
* Version is now 0.2a

7/11/2010 -
* Fixed security hole (already) in ircd.class.php that would allow clients to call functions they
  weren't supposed to such as newConnection().
* Fixed a performance issue with socket_select() and its if bracket.

7/10/2010 -
* Error handling function introduced.
(edit 1)
* Welcome message(s) progress. Need to figure out the 005 numeric which is now RPL_ISUPPORT, probably 
  going to just fill it with nonsense for now until the server is more complete and it is needed.
* More error checking added on initial connect, check for parameter amount, and checks params against
  some regex.
* Dicks everywhere.

7/9/2010 -
* Basically a plain socket server at the moment.
(edit 1)
* Babysteps towards actual irc stuff. Closes link on ping timeout, working on initial connect sequence.
* Expect ircd.class.php rolled out within a day or so.
(edit 2)
* Initial ircd class release.
* NICK error checking working for initial connect. USER next.
* Still need to legitimately NOTICE AUTH instead of just sending that junk.

7/8/2010 -
* Initial alpha-absolutely-nothing-is-done-at-all release.
